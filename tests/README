The sketches in this directory are intended to be checkin tests.
No code should be pushed to github without these tests passing.

See "runtests.sh" script inside each sketch dir.  This script is fully compatible with
git bisest.

Note that this requires python and py-serial

The tests dir needs some reworking. Not entirely sure yet how but some ideas are below.
Todo:

* get rid of jam
* convert to proper test suite
* mock out as much as possible to unit test interaction with rf chip
* what about integration testing with actual chip?
* try and remove python and py-serial dependencies?
* possibly an AVR simulator or a framework to mock out the arduino bits?
